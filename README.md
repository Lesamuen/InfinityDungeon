# InfinityDungeon
A Text-Based Infinitely Generated Dungeon Crawler

Created by Samuel Nguyen (2013)

This was something I made in middle school purely for fun, my first rigorous attempt at programming a project.
Completely in Batch because I didn't know the difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language.
